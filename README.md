### 👋 Hi there, thank you for visiting my profile. 

Let's save your precious time! I (am / have):

* 💼 Ex-Samsung Engineer.
* 📚 Published Android library (via JitPack).
* 🌐 Contributed to Open Source projects.
* 🌍 Collaborated with clients from various nationalities, including Singapore (7+ years), Korea (3 years), Denmark(3 years), Sweden (1.5 years) and others. 
* 🚀 Successfully launched several Android applications on the Google Play Store.
* 🎓 Finished my bachelor's degree, and during that time, I was an assistant with subjects: Automation and Introduction to Compilation + Data Structure assistant at my university.
*  💻 Done some backend work (adding features, bug fixing, writing Unit Tests and Integration Tests) using NodeJS, with a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach.
